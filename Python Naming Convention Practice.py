#Task 1: Code Correction You have been given a piece of code with 
# several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention.
#  Your task is to correct them:
PI = 3.14
User_Age = 25
User_Location = "New York"
MAX_LIMIT = 1000

 naming convention for variables is snake_case and for constants is SNAKE_CASE, user location
and user age are variables, pi value and max limit are constants, so in the exercise 2. Python Naming Convention Practice you have to use the correct names.
