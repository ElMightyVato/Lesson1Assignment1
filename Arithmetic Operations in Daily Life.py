#Task 1: Grocery Store Math
#Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. 
#For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic

bread = 2.43

peanut_butter = 4

jelly = 6

total = (bread+peanut_butter+jelly)
print(total)

#Task 2: Bank Interest
#If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, 
#calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that 
#would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.


principal = 10000
rate = 7

amount = (principal * (1 + rate / 100))
print(amount)
